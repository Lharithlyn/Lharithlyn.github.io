<h1> CSE 5912 Game Design and Development </h1>
<h1>Homework #2</h1>
<p> The following images were created in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015</p>
<img src="HW2_Image1.jpg">
<p> This first image I decided to do something with a photo I took last year.
and tried and make it artsy to look sort of like a watercolor painting.
</p>
<img src="HW2_Image2.jpg">
<p>Here I decided to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOYz669WNpU"> this tutorial</a>
 I saw to create a "double exposure" image. The tutorial provided a link to
the stock photo used for viewers to follow along. </p>
<img src="HW2_Image3.jpg">
<p>For this photo I was originally going for the
"disintegration effect" from Marvel's Infinity War.
However it didn't exactly turn out that way so I added
an image overlay to make it more "artsy". </p>
